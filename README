KTCPVS


What is it?
-----------

KTCPVS stands for Kernel TCP Virtual Server. It implements
application-level load balancing inside the Linux kernel, so called
Layer-7 switching. Although the scalability of KTCPVS is lower than
that of IPVS (IP Virtual Server), it is flexible, because the content
of request is known before the request is redirected to one server.


The Latest Version

Details of the latest version can be found on the Linux Virtual Server
project page under http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/.

SETUP
-----

KTCPVS currently requires that your system is running the Linux kernel
2.4.x.

To build and insert the ipvs modules, the commands can be as follows:
    # build the modules
    cd <path-name>/ktcpvs
    make
    make -C userspace

    # insmod the modules and install ipvsadm
    su
    make install
    insmod ktcpvs_wlc.o
    insmod ktcpvs_http.o

    # set the debugging level
    echo 2 > /proc/sys/net/ktcpvs/debug_level
    
    # ktcpvs configuration
    userspace/tcpvsadm -A -i http -s http
    userspace/tcpvsadm -a -i http -r r1:80
    userspace/tcpvsadm -a -i http -r r2:80
    userspace/tcpvsadm -a -i http -r r3:80
    userspace/tcpvsadm --add-rule -i http --pattern=/images/.* -r r1:80
    userspace/tcpvsadm --add-rule -i http --pattern=/html/.* -r r2:80
    userspace/tcpvsadm --add-rule -i http --pattern=.* -r r3:80

    # list the configuration
    userspace/tcpvsadm --list

    # load configuration from file
    userspace/tcpvsadm -f <config-file>

    # flush all the configuration
    userspace/tcpvsadm -F

    # start/stop server
    userspace/tcpvsadm --start -i http
    userspace/tcpvsadm --stop -i http

    # remove modules
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ktcpvs/unload
    rmmod ktcpvs_wlc
    rmmod ktcpvs_http
    rmmod ktcpvs

Note: please make sure that your running kernel image is built from
the Linux kernel 2.4.xx source under /usr/src/linux. If your Linux
kernel source is not under /usr/src/linux, you need make a symbolic
link /usr/src/linux to your kernel source or edit the ktcpvs Makefile
to specify the path of kernel source. If your running kernel image is
not built from your kernel source, you need to rebuild the running
kernel image with the IP Netfilter option enabled.
    

MAILING LIST

There is a mailing list for the discussion of LVS and its
applications. It is open to anyone to join. I will announce new
versions on this list.

To join the mailing list, send mail with the word "subscribe" in the
Subject field to lvs-users-request@linuxvirtualserver.org.

To send mail to everyone on the list send it to
lvs-users@linuxvirtualserver.org.

mailing list or me.
