I have tested it under CentOS 4.x, support for newer kernel will be added later. Before begin please make sure the kernel-devel package is installed.
Then check out the source code for 2.6 from the subversion: 
 svn co http://svn.linuxvirtualserver.org/repos/ktcpvs/branches/stable_for_2.6.9/ ktcpvs 
Complie & install ktcpvs: 
 cd ktcpvs && make install 
And now, you can use the start script under the ktcpvs directory to start the kernel thread ;) 
 ./start 
You can change the config file as your need, then use "tcpvsadm -f config" to load it, for more details, please refer the manual of tcpvsadm.The default configuration file is /etc/ktcpvs.conf, you can change the default settings in it .
